Things to say round here: 
1- posters outside of tableau got a lot of attention
2- posters with more colors seemed to be more attractive to the public audience
3- posters with writings on them were actually quite attractive to many people in the seabus!  (contradiction with my intuition?)
4- markets got a lot of attention in the seabus
5- The ones with giant photos and good looking text were noticed but not as much as many of the written ones did
6- Good amount of interaction between the ads from a certain ethnicity and their respective people
