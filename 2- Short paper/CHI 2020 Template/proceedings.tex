\section{World-view}
The abstract of the document literally commences with a statement about addressing the issues and challenges of natural user interface designers. The positioning of these statements alongside the essence of conclusion section shows us that the authors are following a "\textbf{Pragmatic World-view}". 

\section{Page Size and Columns}
On each page your material should fit within a rectangle of 7 $\times$
9.15 inches (18 $\times$ 23.2 cm), centered on a US Letter page (8.5
$\times$ 11 inches), beginning 0.85 inches (1.9 cm) from the top of
the page, with a 0.3 inches (0.85 cm) space between two 3.35 inches
(8.4 cm) columns. Right margins should be justified, not
ragged. Please be sure your document and PDF are US letter and not A4.

\section{Typeset Text}
The styles contained in this document have been modified from the
default styles to reflect ACM formatting conventions. For example,
content paragraphs like this one are formatted using the Normal style.

\LaTeX\ sometimes will create overfull lines that extend into columns.
To attempt to combat this, the \texttt{.cls} file has a command,
\texttt{{\textbackslash}sloppy}, that essentially asks \LaTeX\ to
prefer underfull lines with extra whitespace.  For more details on
this, and info on how to control it more finely, check out
{\url{http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/PMAKEUP.HTM}}.

\subsection{Title and Authors}

Your paper's title, authors and affiliations should run across the
full width of the page in a single column 17.8 cm (7 in.) wide.  The
title should be in Helvetica or Arial 18-point bold.  Authors' names
should be in Times New Roman or Times Roman 12-point bold, and
affiliations in 12-point regular.  

See \texttt{{\textbackslash}author} section of this template for
instructions on how to format the authors. For more than three
authors, you may have to place some address information in a footnote,
or in a named section at the end of your paper. Names may optionally
be placed in a single centered row instead of at the top of each
column. Leave one 10-point line of white space below the last line of
affiliations.

\subsection{Abstract and Keywords}

Every submission should begin with an abstract of about 150 words,
followed by a set of Author Keywords and ACM Classification
Keywords. The abstract and keywords should be placed in the left
column of the first page under the left half of the title. The
abstract should be a concise statement of the problem, approach, and
conclusions of the work described. It should clearly state the paper's
contribution to the field of HCI\@.

\subsection{Normal or Body Text}

Please use a 10-point Times New Roman or Times Roman font or, if this
is unavailable, another proportional font with serifs, as close as
possible in appearance to Times Roman 10-point. Other than Helvetica
or Arial headings, please use sans-serif or non-proportional fonts
only for special purposes, such as source code text.

\subsection{First Page Copyright Notice}
This template include a sample ACM copyright notice at the bottom of
page 1, column 1.  Upon acceptance, you will be provided with the
appropriate copyright statement and unique DOI string for publication.
Accepted papers will be distributed in the conference
publications. They will also be placed in the ACM Digital Library,
where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and
practitioners worldwide. See
\url{http://acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy} for the
ACM's copyright and permissions policy.
